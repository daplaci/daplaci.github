I am particularly interested in leveraging machine learning models for healthcare applications.

I have obtained a bachelor and master degree in biomedical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin. My thesis was conducted at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I worked on prediction models for ICU patients. My main focus was expanding current models with features from high-frequency time-series. 

Following this experience, I made the decision to pursue a Ph.D. at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, supervised by SÃ¸ren Brunak. During this time, I investigated how machine learning models may improve healthcare practises. I developed software for clinical decision support and early detection of cancer.
