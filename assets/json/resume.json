I have been actively working on various projects encompassing machine learning applications on diverse and unique datasets, including registries, electronih health records and medical images. Notably, I worked on the development of models for early detection of pancreatic cancer using patient’s disease history from the Danish registries. This study was published in Nature medicine. I also worked on the development of a decision support tool for detecting clinical deterioration using EHR collected in the general depertments, which was published on PLOS digital heath. Other projects involved survival analysis in the ICU and pharmacovigilance using NLP techniques.",

To accomplish this, I had to deploy the ML model on a new cloud, Google cloud platform, and develop a new pipeline for the data preprocessing.",
