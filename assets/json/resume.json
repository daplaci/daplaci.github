    "summary": "With my BSc and MSc degrees in biomedical engineering complimented by my recent PhD in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, I believe my profile is a very good fit for the role as Post-doc/Data Scientist in Healthcare Data Predictive Modelling at Novo Nordisk. During my last 4 years of research experience I have worked on predictive models using real world data (electronic health records and Danish registries) resulting in numerous published tools and research articles. This allowed me to develop the technical skills required for this job, including developing and validating ML models across multiple healthcare systems, applying survival analysis in non conventional models, and developing viable, secure, and maintainable software solutions. While my background could be applicable to numerous data science jobs, my passion for healthcare has kept my focus within health-related industries, especially at Novo where there are so many applicable areas that pique my interest. My research experiences and internal/international collaboration efforts have additionally cultivated my problem-solving skills when developing wide-serving complex data science solutions. These skills in addition to my strong technical background and project team experiences have prepared me well to be an effective communicator. I believe I fulfil the requirements as listed within the job advert and look forward to the opportunity to present myself in person to discuss my potential contributions further.",
